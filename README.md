# Scavenger Hunt

1. This is a place a of firsts'. I wanted it to be "Cosmic", but that place closed down two days ago. In the annals of our history this event was a celebration of firsts. (Have lunch its one me!)
2. `Eye` Sculputer - Lev. 24:20. The one in the middle. (I need a touristy photo)
3. The Taschen Library - Big Butts. Small Graphs. Tall Buildings. This room has it all. Enter if you dare.
4. The Book of Symbols - Yellow Hour Glasses, The Planets, weird clues in a scavenger hunt; everything has meaning. This book might contain the truth you seek. (If you get stuck ask Miranda for help) 
5. In a world of excess some seek to 'rough it'. A change of scenery might do some good. BUT! Escpecially while CAMPING, I know my baby couldn't go with out these. (Send me a photo of these from this special STORE, holding your must-have item. Reciept and all.)
6. Half Price Book - Success can be our ruin. While they are true to their name sake. Some might get mad at whole prices. Check out what Michael's boss is selling, but don't go bothering any one in the office. (Buy a book from this author!)
7. Drinks -
